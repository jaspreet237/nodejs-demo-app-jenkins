ðŸ”„ How Jenkins Works in This Project

When code is committed and pushed to GitHub:

Jenkins pulls the latest code from the GitHub repo

Builds a new Docker image using the Dockerfile

Pushes the image to Docker Hub

Pipeline status can be viewed in Jenkins Dashboard

âœ… Testing the Pipeline

Make a change in app.js (e.g., change the text message)

Triggers the Jenkins pipeline
